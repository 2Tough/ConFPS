# ConFPS

This is from a tutorial to make a simple shooter view, inspired by the likes of Wolfenstein. I learned about the basics of C++ and the logic
behind such games. The idea to build a labyrinth seemed nice as it could be integrated using existing logic and would make the game more 
interactive and fun.
